# SuperOffice Developer Roadmap

This document provides a **high-level view of upcoming initiatives** for the SuperOffice developer platform and APIs.  

The roadmap is not a commitment, but a transparent way to share what we are exploring, planning, and building — and to invite community feedback.

## 📌 How to Read This Roadmap

- **Now** → Currently being worked on or planned for the immediate release cycle.  
- **Next** → Planned for upcoming releases (medium-term).  
- **Later** → Future ideas, under consideration, or dependent on other work.  

Each item may link to a corresponding proposal in [/proposals](./proposals).

## 🔜 Next (planned)

- **Tenant telemetry APIs** → Exposing non-sensitive system metrics for integrations
- **GraphQL exploration** → Evaluate GraphQL support alongside REST APIs  
- **API versioning strategy** → Define approach for versioning APIs and backward compatibility
- **Rate limiting** → Implementing rate limiting (throttling) for APIs to ensure fair usage
- **Event Streaming** → Investigate push-based event delivery (Kafka, WebSockets, etc.)  
- **API consistency review** → Naming and schema alignment across REST endpoints  

---

## 🌱 Later (under consideration)

- **gRPC support** → Investigate gRPC as an alternative API protocol
- **Custom workflow APIs** → Extending automation with partner-defined triggers
