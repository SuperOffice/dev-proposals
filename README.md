# SuperOffice Developer Proposals

Welcome 👋 This repository is the home for **ideas, proposals, specifications, and roadmap discussions** related to the SuperOffice developer platform and APIs.  

Our goal is to **collaborate openly with partners, customers, and the developer community** on the future of the SuperOffice platform.  

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Share upcoming **roadmaps** and planned initiatives  
- Collect **proposals** for new APIs, features, and improvements  
- Provide a transparent process for reviewing and discussing changes  
- Serve as a historical archive of **accepted, rejected, or deferred proposals**  

This repo is *not* for bug reports or product support. Please use [SuperOffice support](https://support.superoffice.com) or [SuperOffice community](https://community.superoffice.com) for that.

## 📝 How to Propose a Change

2. If none exist, **open a new proposal**:
   - Copy the [proposal template](./proposals/template.md).  
   - Save it under `/proposals/YYYY/NNN-title.md` (year + sequential ID).  
   - Open a **pull request**.  
3. The community and SuperOffice team will review, comment, and refine.  
4. Proposals will eventually be marked as:
   - ✅ **Accepted**
   - ❌ **Rejected**
   - 🕗 **Deferred** (not now, maybe later)

For small suggestions, feel free to start with a **GitHub Issue** or **Discussion**.

## 📜 Proposal Lifecycle

A proposal goes through these phases:

- **Draft** → initial idea, open for comments  
- **In Review** → actively being discussed and refined  
- **Accepted** → approved and scheduled for implementation  
- **Implemented** → shipped and documented  
- **Rejected/Deferred** → closed, with rationale recorded
