## üìù Submitting a Proposal

If you want to suggest a new API, feature, or design change, follow these steps:

1. **Check for existing proposals** in [/proposals](./proposals).  
   - Avoid duplicates by searching open and closed proposals.  

2. **Create a new proposal file**:
   - Copy the [proposal template](./proposals/template.md).  
   - Save it under:

     ```text
     /proposals/YYYY/NNN-title.md
     ```

     - `YYYY` = current year  
     - `NNN` = next available proposal number (e.g., 001, 002, 003‚Ä¶)  
     - `title` = short-dashed-title (e.g., `incremental-search-api`)  

3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** with your proposal.  
   - Give it a clear title: `Proposal: Incremental Search API`  
   - Add a short summary in the PR description.  

4. **Discuss and refine**  
   - Community members and the SuperOffice team will review, ask questions, and suggest changes.  
   - Expect a few iterations before a decision is reached.

## üìú Proposal Lifecycle

Each proposal will go through these phases:

- **Draft** ‚Üí newly submitted, open for comments  
- **In Review** ‚Üí under active discussion and refinement  
- **Accepted** ‚Üí approved and planned for implementation  
- **Implemented** ‚Üí shipped and documented in the product  
- **Rejected** ‚Üí declined, with rationale recorded

The status is tracked at the top of each proposal document.
